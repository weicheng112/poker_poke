## Winning

There are two ways to win in Texas Hold'em:

1. Everyone folds to your bet:

   - If you bet or raise, and everyone else folds, you win the pot immediately â€” no need to show your cards.

2. Showdown (final comparison)

- If two or more players call the final bet, you go to showdown:
- Everyone still in reveals their hole cards.

## Example â€“ Who Wins?

```
Player 1            Player 2            Player 3
 __   __             __  __               __  __
|Aâ™ | |Kâ™ |           |9â™£||9â™¦|             |Jâ™ ||Qâ™ |
|__| |__|           |__||__|             |__||__|
          Community Cards:
           [Flop]             [Turn]    [River]
            ___  __  __        __         __
           |10â™ ||5â™¦||Qâ™¦|      |Kâ™£|       |Jâ™¥|
           |___||__||__|      |__|       |__|
```

Now calculate:

Player 1: Aâ™  Kâ™  + Qâ™¦ Kâ™£ Jâ™¥ = Straight (10-J-Q-K-A)

Player 2: Pair of 9s

Player 3: Jâ™  Qâ™  + Qâ™¦ Kâ™£ Jâ™¥ = Two pair (Jacks and Queens)

âœ… Player 1 wins with a straight
